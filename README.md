# pdf_merge
A simple utility to merge images - such as scanned pages - into a single PDF document.

## Introdruction
Many printer-scanners have an automatic feed scanner. This allows multi-page documents to be scanned, without the user having to place each page on the scanner bed by hand. However, some scanners (including mine!) with an automatic feed are not able to do two-sided (duplex) scanning. This simple Python module aims to assist with scanning two-sided, multi-page documents using such scanners. Its purpose is to combine individual image files obtained from the automatic feed scanning into a single PDF document.
